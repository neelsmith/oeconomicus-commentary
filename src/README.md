This [[Obsidian]] vault is a template for developing a student guide to a citable text of Xenophon's *Oeconomicus*.


## Organization of contents of this vault

### Passages of Xenophon

In the `passages` directory, Xenophon's text is organized in notes you can link to  by surrounding canonical references with double brackets , like `[[7.1]]`.  Here is an example: follow the linked reference to see the content of [[7.1]].

You can also "quote" passages using the `!` prefix on a citation.  Here's what happens if you include `![[7.1]]` in your text:

![[7.1]]


## Text reader with commentary and other resources

The `reader` directory has one file per citable passage, named `reader` + passage reference.

Each file includes links to embed various kinds of content, based on file naming conventions.  The four categories are:

- content of passage (included from `passages` folder, cited by canonical reference)
- commentary (included from `commentary` folder, cited as canonical reference preceded by `commentary `)
- vocabulary (included from `vocab` folder, cited as canonical reference preceded by `vocab `)
- syntax (included from `syntax` folder, cited as canonical reference preceded by `syntax `)
