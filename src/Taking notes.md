You can include Markdown in your text in Obsidian, e.g., to **emphasize** things, or to link to other sources on the internet like [a quick introduction to Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).

In addition, Obsidian allows to link to content in the "vault" using wiki-style double brackets. Here, I'm including a *link* to section [[7.1]] of the *Oeconomicus* in my text.

In the next paragraph, I'm prefixing the reference with a `!` to *embed* the content (rather than link to it.)  Notice that Obsidian thoughtfully includes a link into the source note. 

![[7.1]]

In this line, I'm using this project's convention of prefixing `reader ` to a passage reference to link into a full commentary, like this: [[reader 7.1]].

This template vault also includes an empty `notes` folder where you can keep your notes organized.
